# Integration-of-SQL-and-Tableau-to-get-useful-insights-from-employees_mod-database
- SQL was used to obtain relevant table for the chart which was later imported to Tableau and the required charts were made. 
- All the charts were finally organized into a dashboard.

# Tasks performed
TASK 1: Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

TASK 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

TASK 3: Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.

TASK 4: Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.
Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.
